# Screenshot Note

A screenshot.png file (1200x900px) should be added to this theme to display a preview in the WordPress admin panel.

The screenshot should showcase:
- The header with logo and navigation
- Hero section with theme name
- Product grid showing 4 products in a row
- Footer with copyright information

Recommended tool: Take a screenshot of the live theme or create one using image editing software like Photoshop, GIMP, or Figma.
